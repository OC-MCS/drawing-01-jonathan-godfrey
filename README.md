Two problems:   
1) draws off edge of screen on bottom/right (draws partial shapes)   
2) Bug with settings is that you're drawing settings buttons in handleMouseUp. Drawing settings should be handled in draw() function,    
that way it will handle all cases (both initial defaults and future changes). handleMouseUp should only change data, not render it.   
Grade: 46/50
